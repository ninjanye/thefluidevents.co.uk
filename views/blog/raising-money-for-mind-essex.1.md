# Raising money for Mind in Essex

More than 80 guests attended our quiz night on Wednesday 4th April at the wonderful Hawkwell Baptist Church in Rochford, Essex. 11 teams packed the hall eager to pit their wits against each other in an six round test to be crowned champions. ‘Flo’ our mobile prosecco van was also on hand providing our guests some very welcomed chilled Prosecco and Stella on tap!

A big well done to John Nye, our amazing quiz master for keeping the crowd entertained and a big congratulations to our winning team ‘No Brians’. Maybe see you on Eggheads next?
 
The Fluid Events team would like thank everyone for their help and amazing generosity on the night and for making the event the success it was.
