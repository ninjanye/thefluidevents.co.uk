# The taste test... choosing Prosecco

Our journey to create the perfect Prosecco Van has begun. It has been very involving, with lots of decisions to make from the type of vehicle, to the paint, but most importantly "The Prosecco". Choosing the right Prosecco is the most important part of any party so with this in mind we threw a small party of our own. We had previously narrowed our choices to two and gave our guests the opportunity to decide...

The winner was unanimous...The Prosecco poured a bright straw yellow colour, it was pleasant and fruity, with a perfect intensity and you could taste the Glera Grape with every sip. It had a fresh flavour and was undoubtedly the smoothest and most enjoyable of the two, leaving everyone wanting more.

**Congratulations to Corte Delli Calli**, a fabulous Prosecco originating from Provincia di Treviso, Veneto in Italy.
 
We love our Prosecco, but more importantly we think you will love it too and can't wait to share it with you at your next event.
