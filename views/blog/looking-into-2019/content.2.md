We also have a Weddings coming up which we are looking forward to. These are obviously set up differently to the fetes and fayres. Everything is pre-paid and organised beforehand and we always endeavor to set the scene exactly as the Bride and Groom wish it to be. We like to bring fresh flowers and decorate the Tuk Tuk to match their theme wherever possible. It’s an amazing experience to be part of someone’s special day. There is such happiness and joy within everyone, not only for the newlyweds but also their guests, that you can’t help but smile as you a part of something amazing too.

Finally, Christmas. Last year it was a super crazy time... we took part in two huge Christmas markets that we had to make sure we were prepared for. I have to mention Stock Christmas Festival first. They gave us our first big break in December 2017 and it was a fabulous event then, even though it was their first year too. In 2018, they made it even bigger and better, and for a small rural village in Essex that is some feat! We had a fantastic time there.
As we approach the end of January and look towards February, the year already seems like it is starting to fly by! The Fluid Events Company hopes that we can meet you all at an event soon and that 2019 is turning out to be everything you hoped it would be so far.
