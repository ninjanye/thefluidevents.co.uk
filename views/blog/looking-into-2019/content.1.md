# Looking into 2019
<sub>30th January 2019</sub>

It’s January, a quiet time of year for us as far as gigs go, but a busy time for us to get ourselves noticed and get business for the upcoming year. The mobile bar business is competitive and we need to make sure we are first in the queue when people think “ooo I think a Prosecco Van would be perfect for this...but where could I find one?”

However, as we found last year, doing the research for events and getting the business in is always easier said than done, especially when you have young families. Squeezing it into family time or making sure your 3 year old doesn’t press “delete” or “send” at the wrong time because he wants to see what you are doing is a constant battle. The local coffee shop has recently become a haven for us, with wifi, good coffee and breakfast we can battle on, put our heads down and get done what we need to get done whilst the kids are at school. It has made a massive difference for us.

As for 2019, there is lots to look forward to. June is looking busy already. We have some exciting jobs lined up with 3 of our local schools. We are a family that has lived in the Southend area all of our lives so these events really excite us...
