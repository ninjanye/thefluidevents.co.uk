### Quiz nights are thirsty work

Over the course of the evening our mobile prosecco bar served nearly 80 pints of lager and over 120 glasses of prosecco, all the proceeds of which went to [Mind.org](http://mind.org) charity. This all helped us raise a stagering total for the evening of over Â£1,500!

Thank you to all the generous companies in and around Essex who contributed tombola prizes. We would also like to say a very special thank you to Hawkwell Baptist Church for accomodating our prosecco van at the very last minute.

Look forward to doing it all again next year!
